# Chatter

---

Chatter is an online chat app that allows people to join a chatroom and chat with one another. Chatter uses websockets to provide a realtime chat experience.

### Description

---

Chatter is built using the t3 stack (Typescript, tRPC, and Tailwind). The stack also includes NextJS, and Prisma. The main goal of this project was for me to gain understanding of how web sockets are used.

### Challenges

---

Setting up the web sockets was the most challenging as I have no prior experience with web sockets. I quite enjoyed thoroughly reading the tRPC docs to gain a better understanding of the technology. I am also relatively new to NextJS, and browsed the docs once again to learn more about routing and passing parameters around.

### Nuggets of information

- I have not used curors before for paginating results from a database, but this is quite a cool technique that I discovered while building this application.
- I also discovered `useInfiniteQuery` while building this application which is a cool feature of ReactQuery.
